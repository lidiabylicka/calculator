# calculator

calculator excercise
when stuck on adding / substractions etc => this video helped me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IxIyI3JomE
also: naming each button with value and id was not needed;
learned about textContent property;
learned about eval()
added bright / dark mode --> still cannot figure out why default formatting of the CLEAR button is displaying when page refreshed (before toggle clicked)
